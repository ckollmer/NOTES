On peut ainsi regarder l’évolution des espèces, non par le seul biais de la dynamique décrite par Darwin, qui va de la racine aux extrémités des embranchements, mais sous l’angle de l’union d’organismes différents, de génomes disparates évoluant pour leur propre compte, mais que la symbiose sélectionne pour un avantage évolutif de l’ensemble.

The 1952 Hershey-Chase experiment took just this tack, employing phosphorus-32 to label the DNA and sulfur-35 to label the protein of a bacterial virus, or bacteriophage. (p.222) Subsequent infection with each type of labeled phage showed that only the phosphorus-32-labeled nucleic acid component of the virus entered the bacterial cell to a significant extent.5 Up until that point, most biologists assumed that protein, perhaps in conjunction with nucleic acid (as a “nucleoprotein”, was the hereditary material of living organisms, including viruses.

Il imagine alors – fallait-il avoir 19 ans pour nourrir l’intuition d’un tel comportement ? – que le phénomène repose sur une sexualité bactérienne.

Si ce mécanisme n’est pas le seul mode d’échange génétique entre bactéries, il faut reconnaître que le monde du vivant se trouve ainsi en partie unifié autour de mécanismes de reproduction.

The coordination of time in the half-century following 1860 simply does not sublime in a slow, even-paced process from the technological field upward into the more rarified realms of science and philosophy. Nor did ideas of time synchronization originate in a pure realm of thought and then condense into the objects and actions of machines and factories. In its fluctuations back and forth between the abstract and the concrete, in its variegated scales, time coordination emerges in the volatile phase changes of critical opalescence.

(inter alia) the definition of local time to make the mathematical correspondence exact between fictional moving frames and the true resting one. But the crucial point for Poincaré was not that he had slightly modified Lorentz’s theory. Rather, it was this: Poincaré had demonstrated that clocks coordinated as they moved through the ether would give exactly Lorentz’s new local time and would do so for real observers moving in that frame. The relativity principle held good, even while Poincaré continued to oppose “apparent time” to “true time.” By 1906, Poincaré had placed the light-coordination of clocks front and center for three projects fundamental to modern knowledge:

Throughout his physics—but also throughout his philosophy, technology, and politics—Poincaré saw his world as improvable through rational, intuitive intervention; he reveled in pushing a problem into “crisis” and then resolving it. His was the optimism of a progressive engineer willing to reassemble major struts and cables of the structures he tackled, but insisting that the built world of “our fathers” be respected, incorporated, improved.

The ghetto had always been a main feature of landed capital, a prime moneymaker for those who saw ripe opportunity in land scarcity, housing dilapidation, and racial segregation.

À sa base, celui-ci est emmanché dans un tube coudé inséré dans l’enveloppe qui habille la bactérie. Ces flagelles sont eux-mêmes entourés de plusieurs anneaux formant un véritable moteur. La mécanique est mise en mouvement par un flux de protons, qui s’écoule vers l’extérieur à travers la membrane, créant ainsi un flux de l’énergie.

Theis offers the same reason that Rawls, King, and Hadfield did: it’s inevitable. Every surface is populated by microbes, which release volatile chemicals. If those chemical cues reflect a trait that’s useful to know about – say, gender, strength, or fertility – the host animal might evolve scent organs to nourish and harbour those specific microbes. Eventually, the inadvertent cues turn into full-blown signals.

Wolbachia, then, is a microbe of many guises. Some strains act as ur-parasites, selfish manipulators of such skill that they have spread throughout the world on the wings and legs of legions of hosts; they kill animals, warp their biology, and lay restrictions upon their choices. Other strains are mutualists, boons, indispensable allies. Some are both. And in this multifarious nature, Wolbachia is not alone.

Such arrangements, which are especially common among insects, tend to trap microbes in a predictable spiral of simplification. In the cells of their hosts, they are restricted to small populations and kept apart from other bacteria. Their isolation allows harmful mutations to build up in their DNA. Any gene that’s not essential becomes faulty and useless, before disappearing altogether.43 If you stuck a new symbiont into an insect and played the evolutionary tape on fast-forward, you’d see violent turmoil as its genome contorted and crunched, warped and shrank. Eventually, they end up with shrivelled genomes, close to the minimum necessary for life. A typical free-living microbe like E. coli has a genome consisting of about 4,600,000 DNA letters.

In den Wahnsinn. Deswegen habe ich jegliches Gerede verboten. – Die Schreiber vor der Tür … – Jede Eingabe muß schriftlich erfolgen. Vor dem Gericht wird nicht geredet. Nur das Urteil spricht. Hier herrscht täglich Schweigen. Ich versuche diesen Menschen begreiflich zu machen, wie wichtig es ist, das Reden im Zaum zu halten.

The carbon dioxide that humans unleash into the atmosphere warms the oceans by trapping the sun’s heat. In these warmer seas, corals expel the algae that live inside their cells and provide them with nutrients. Bereft of these partners, they become weak and ghostly. The carbon dioxide also dissolves in the oceans directly, acidifying them. This depletes the minerals that corals need to build their reefs, which start to wear away. Hurricanes, ships, and voracious starfish erode them even further. Starving, pallid, homeless, and deprived of mortar, the poor corals get sick. They fall victim to a colour chart of pestilence: white pox, black band disease, pink line disease, red band disease.

In the 1940s, microbiologist James Reyniers and engineer Philip Trexler developed ways of mass-producing germ-free rodents (Kirk, 2012). They would remove uteruses from pregnant females, bathe them in disinfectants, transfer them into isolators, cut the foetuses out, and then rear them by hand. In this way, they bred germ-free mice, rats, and guinea pigs, before moving on to pigs, cats, dogs and even monkeys. The technique was clearly successful but those early isolators, with their cold steel, chunky gauntlets and small viewing windows, were inconvenient and prohibitively expensive. By 1957, Trexler had devised a plastic version with rubber gloves similar to those in Gordon’s lab. It was easier to use and cost a tenth as much to make.

Microbes have been using these substances to fight each other for as long as they have existed. Humans first tapped into this ancient arsenal in 1928 – by accident. On returning to his lab from a holiday in the country, British chemist Alexander Fleming noticed that a mould had landed in one of his bacterial cultures and had carved out a kill-zone of slaughtered microbes all around it.

If a plant-eater ingested microbes that could break down complex fibres in plants and in doing so release otherwise inaccessible chemical by-products that their cells can burn for energy, the microbes would fit in immediately. By getting on with their usual activities, in a purely selfish way, they incidentally benefit their hosts. These “by-product mutualisms” are the perfect first handshake.

Although, as a scholarly profession, the history of science has come a long way since 1912, when George Sarton founded the journal Isis, 4 today an aspiring young historian of science may still be under considerable pressure to emphasize the intellectual, social, or political features of a scientific development, at the expense of a thorough treatment of its technical aspects.

My admiration of the scientific achievements of these menand, in the case of Weaver, of his program for the support of what he called publicly during the 1930s quantitative biology (hence the name of the Cold Spring Harbor symposia)is unbounded. I find, however, in most of the historical accounts special pleading for the roles of particular individuals or groups in the generation of the new "molecular vision of life." Moreover, before about 1960, that vision was not only "molecular" but also "chemical."

The language of the interplay may have changed, but the course of the development of knowledge about the "chemical basis of heredity" still depended on the empirical discovery of previously unknown chemical constituents of biological systems, as well as on the invention of new methods and instruments or improvement of older ones for the study of chemical structure and chemical interaction.

Les jours passent et il lui semble que ces collègues n’ont pas levé le nez de l’écran de télévision installé au milieu de l’open space. Jour après jour, les images de l’avenue Bourguiba noire de monde défilent. Une foule, jeune et bruyante, célèbre la victoire. Des femmes pleurent dans les bras des soldats.

But in Dublin, where no one knew her or her family, she felt she had to prove herself. She felt awkward in Dublin, although she liked being in the city. The women on the farms in Ireland had no life at all, she said. In the country, everything was for the boys, the sons. She felt that the people in Dublin looked down on her for her country accent, and she was afraid that her clothes would never look as smart as they should. She often wondered if people were laughing at her. She was very uncertain.

When she was with a poor person, standing inside her front door talking to them as they stood on her front step, or doing something in the kitchen while they sat and had tea at her table, she was ashamed of having as much as she had, but when she was with other people—the people her husband used to bring home occasionally the first year or two they had the house, or with her children’s teachers at the school, or with people in shops—she was ashamed of her own appearance and of the shortcomings in her dress and in her children’s dress.

Mrs. Dolan’s face grew ruminative, and Betty’s profile suggested she was lost in recollections that were not unhappy.

It was the rule rather than the exception: “a widespread, though always supplementary, device, enhancing the vital possibilities of the host animals in a multiplicity of ways”.

By her own account, she leapt up and proclaimed that the worms had bacteria in their bodies, which were using sulphur to make energy. Jones reportedly told her to sit down. Then, he gave her a worm to study. Cavanaugh’s epiphany was both right and revolutionary.11 Under the microscope, she found that Riftia’s trophosome was full of bacteria, about a billion of them for every gram of tissue.

Der General hatte einen Mann aufhängen lassen, weil dieser seine Frau niederstach, als er herausfand, daß sie ihn betrog. Das Problem war, der Mann hatte reagiert, wie es von einem Mann dort erwartet wurde. Beim geringsten Anlaß schneiden die Kerle dort ihre Frauen in Stücke. Wenn er die Frau am Leben gelassen hätte, wären er und auch seine Söhne entehrt gewesen. Die Schande wäre gewaltig. Unvorstellbar. Sie würden wie Ausgestoßene sein, die Zielscheibe allen Spottes. Ihre Freunde würden sich zurückziehen. Der General wollte ein Zeichen setzen, daß die Zeiten sich geändert haben.

La nuit, Adèle écoute son souffle, ses ronflements, tous ces bruits rauques qui font la vie à deux. Elle ferme les yeux et se fait toute petite. Le visage au bord du lit, la main dans le vide, elle n’ose pas se retourner. Elle pourrait déplier un genou, tendre le bras, faire semblant de dormir et effleurer sa peau. Mais elle ne bouge pas. Si elle le touchait, même par inadvertance, il pourrait se mettre en colère, changer d’avis, la jeter dehors. Quand elle est sûre qu’il dort, Adèle se tourne. Elle le regarde, dans le lit qui tremble, dans cette chambre où tout lui paraît fragile. Plus aucun geste, jamais, ne sera innocent. Elle en conçoit une terreur et une joie immenses.

Que face à une vie qui s’écroule, ce genre de mondanités aurait dû n’avoir aucune importance. Mais il s’y raccrochait comme à une planche de survie. « On fête l’anniversaire et après on verra. » Il lui avait donné des instructions. Il ne voulait pas la voir faire la tête ou pleurer. Elle devait être souriante, joyeuse, parfaite. « Toi qui es si douée pour faire illusion. » L’idée que quelqu’un l’apprenne, que ça se sache, suffisait à lui provoquer une crise d’angoisse. Si Adèle devait quitter le foyer familial, il faudrait trouver une explication, monter un scénario banal. Dire qu’ils ne s’entendaient plus et c’est tout. Il lui avait fait jurer de ne se confier à personne. Et de ne plus jamais prononcer le nom de Lauren en sa présence. Le samedi, ils ont gonflé les ballons en silence. Ils ont décoré l’appartement, et Richard a fait un effort surhumain pour ne pas hurler sur Lucien qui courait comme un fou d’une pièce à l’autre. Il n’a pas répondu à Odile qui s’étonnait qu’il boive autant en plein milieu de l’après-midi. « C’est un goûter d’enfant, non ? » Lucien était heureux. À dix-neuf heures, il s’est endormi tout habillé, au milieu de ses nouveaux jouets. Ils se sont retrouvés tous les deux. Adèle est venue vers lui, souriante, le regard illuminé. « Ça s’est bien passé, non ? » Couché sur le canapé, il l’a regardée ranger le salon et son calme lui a semblé monstrueux. Il n’arrivait plus à la supporter. Le moindre geste l’agaçait. Sa façon de placer une mèche derrière ses oreilles. Sa langue sur sa lèvre inférieure. Sa manie de jeter brutalement la vaisselle dans l’évier, de fumer sans arrêt. Il ne lui trouvait aucun charme, aucun intérêt. Il avait envie de la battre, de la voir disparaître.

Parfois, dans un de ces accès de mélancolie, il chantait en arabe une chanson dont il ne leur dévoila jamais le sens. Il s’emportait contre Simone en l’accusant de l’avoir arraché à ses racines. Il se mettait en colère, il devenait injuste, il hurlait qu’il n’avait pas besoin de tout cela, qu’il pourrait bien tout foutre en l’air et s’en aller vivre, seul, dans un endroit modeste, à se nourrir de pain et d’olives noires. Il disait qu’il aurait voulu apprendre à labourer, à semer, à retourner la terre. Qu’il aurait aimé la vie paisible des paysans de son enfance. Et que parfois, il lui arrivait même de les envier, comme l’oiseau fatigué d’un long vol peut envier la fourmi. Simone riait, d’un rire cruel qui le mettait au défi. Et il ne partait pas. Jamais.

Ils ne prennent pas de nouvelles de leurs amis, des copains de fac, des anciens collègues. Ils trouvent des excuses pour qu’on ne vienne pas les voir. Beaucoup se sont étonnés de leur départ précipité. Mais personne n’a cherché à savoir ce qu’ils étaient devenus. Comme si Paris les avait oubliés.

Elle bouge les hanches, les épaules, elle remue la tête d’un côté puis de l’autre. Une vague de calme l’envahit. Elle a le sentiment de se soustraire au monde, de vivre un instant de grâce. Elle retrouve le plaisir qu’elle avait, adolescente, à danser pendant des heures, parfois seule sur la piste. Innocente et belle.

The field mouse the cats brought in this morning has been living in the box you arranged for it in the bedroom all day, waiting for the darkness, when you will put it out again, and the cats will probably catch it again, and in any case it has nothing ahead of it but fear and the search for food.

As a matter of fact, she had no complaints at all, but she could not help wondering what had been going on in the mind of the architect when he made his scale drawing for this room. He had got in all that the action of the operetta called for. There never was so much big detail in a room. Doors and windows and fireplace all stood out in their full theatrical size, all surrounded with big frames of blackened wood, so that you could see from a mile away what you were looking at. Only, there was no room left for walls. The architect forgot about the walls.

Neither the mealybug nor the two bacteria can make phenylalanine on their own; they depend on each other to fill the gaps in their repertoires. This reminds me of the Graeae of Greek mythology: the three sisters who share one eye and one tooth between them. Anything more would be redundant: their arrangement, though odd, still allows them to see and chew. So it is with the mealybug and its symbionts. They ended up with a single metabolic network, distributed between their three complementary genomes.

would-be microbiome manipulators are trying to introduce microbes to hosts in a bid to restore disrupted ecosystems or even forge new symbioses. They are developing cocktails of beneficial microbes that we can take to correct and forestall illnesses, packages of nutrients that will feed those microbes, and even ways of transplanting entire communities from one individual to another. This is what medicine looks like when you understand that microbes are not the enemies of animals, but the foundations upon which our kingdom is built.

The word “probiotic” means “for life”. It is the opposite of antibiotics in both etymology and intention. Antibiotics are designed to remove microbes from our bodies, while probiotics represent a deliberate attempt to add them. In the early twentieth century, the Russian Elie Metchnikoff was one of the first scientists to champion this idea; for several decades he regularly drank sour milk in an effort to ingest lactic-acid-making bacteria, which he held responsible for extending the lives of Bulgarian peasants.

In the early twentieth century, the Russian Elie Metchnikoff was one of the first scientists to champion this idea; for several decades he regularly drank sour milk in an effort to ingest lactic-acid-making bacteria, which he held responsible for extending the lives of Bulgarian peasants. But following his death, microbiologists Christian Herter and Arthur Isaac Kendall showed that the microbes that Metchnikoff idolised don’t persist in the gut. Swallow them all you like – they won’t hang around. Yet despite puncturing Metchnikoff’s idea, Kendall defended the spirit of it. “The time is coming when human intestinal lactic-acid bacteria will be used extensively in the correction of certain types of intestinal microbic disease,” he wrote. “Science will discover and point out the conditions essential for success.”

non-profit organisation that methodically reviews medical studies – has done exactly that. According to their verdicts, probiotics can shorten bouts of infectious diarrhoea, and reduce the risk of diarrhoea brought about by antibiotic treatments. They can also save lives from necrotising enterocolitis – a horrible gut disease that affects premature infants. And there ends the list. Compared to the hype, it’s modest.

Indeed, we humans are unusual in our aversion to faeces. Many other animals practise coprophagy, and will gamely swallow each other’s dung and droppings to acquire microbes. In this way, bumblebees and termites spread bacteria that act as a colony-wide immune system to defend against parasites and pathogens.30

Faecal transplants have been taking place on and off for at least 1,700 years. The earliest record comes from a handbook of emergency medicine written in fourth-century China.32 Europeans took much longer to cotton on: in 1697, a German physician recommended the technique in a book with the unparalleled name of Heilsame Dreck-Apotheke – Salutary Filth-Pharmacy. It was rediscovered by an American surgeon named Ben Eiseman in 1958, but just one year later was over taken subsumed by the introduction of vancomycin, an antibiotic that worked well against C-diff. As Khoruts once wrote, FMT “retreated to merely anecdotal use, sporadically reported and providing amusing reading for a number of decades”.

Outdoors, the air was full of harmless microbes from plants and soils. Indoors, it contained a disproportionate number of potential pathogens, which are normally rare or absent in the outside world, but had been launched from the mouths and skins of hospital residents. The patients were effectively stewing in their own microbial juices. And the best way of fixing that was remarkably simple: open a window. The legendary life-saver Florence Nightingale advocated as much some 150 years earlier. She had no explicit knowledge of the microbiome but, during the Crimean War, she noticed that patients would recover from infections more readily if she opened a window. “Always, air from the air without, and that, too, through those windows through which the air comes freshest,” she wrote.

In der Nacht von Shiva, in der vorhergehenden Nacht und an dem Tag zuvor, er gehörte so sehr dazu, ihn reizte die Vorstellung, für den Rest seines Lebens Teil dieser Familie, dieses Ortes, dieser Rituale zu sein. Er erschrak über diese Lust.

The measure of time is a convention, one tied to the realities of scientific procedure. It is essential, however, to also see what the paper was not. Poincaré’s “Measure of Time” was not an inquiry into simultaneity that took this principled correction of simultaneity into the heart of his physics.

Poincaré believed that the redefinition of time was another longitude hunter’s correction that should not ultimately dent the simplicity of Newton’s epochal laws: “These rules are not imposed on us, and one can amuse oneself by inventing others. Nonetheless we would not know how to deviate from these rules without greatly complicating the formulation of the laws of physics, of mechanics, of astronomy.” We choose these rules, Poincaré insisted in oft-cited words, not because they are true, but because they are convenient.

Nuclear reactors could be used to generate radioactive isotopes—unstable variants of chemical elements that give off detectable radiation.2 Scientists began using radioisotopes in biomedical experiments two decades before the atomic age, but their availability remained small-scale until nuclear reactors were (p.2) developed for the bomb project. In planning for postwar atomic energy, leaders of the Manhattan Project proposed converting a large reactor at Oak Ridge, part of the infrastructure for the bomb project, into a production site for radioisotopes for civilian scientists. The US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) inherited this plan and oversaw an expansive program making isotopes available for research, therapy, and industry. This book is an account of the uses of radioisotopes as a way to shed new light on the consequences of the “physicists' war” for postwar biology and medicine.

The political value of radioisotopes derived from their scientific and medical utility. Isotopes differ from ordinary atoms by having an alternate (often greater) number of neutrons. Stable isotopes persist indefinitely with this extra nuclear baggage, and can be identified on account of their increased atomic mass. Radioisotopes, by contrast, can be detected when they decay to another—usually stable—form, by emitting at least one of three kinds of radiation. Alpha particles (each made up of two protons and two neutrons) do not go far, and cannot pass through paper. Beta particles (high-energy electrons or positrons) are more penetrating, but can be stopped by wood. Gamma rays have high energy and travel the longest distance in air; they are stopped only by dense materials such as lead or concrete. The radiation hazard associated with each radioisotope depends on how frequently it decays (its half-life), and on the kind and energy of the particles emitted when it does.

Physiologists followed the assimilation and turnover of key nutrients and tagged molecules such as insulin to track the movement and activity of hormones. Molecular biologists labeled nucleic acids with radioisotopes to follow the replication and expression of genes. Physicians utilized radioisotopes such as radioiodine and radiophosphorus to diagnose thyroid function and detect tumors. Ecologists profited as well, using phosphorus-32 to trace nutrient cycling through the living and nonliving parts of aquatic and terrestrial landscapes, giving concrete meaning to the notion of an ecosystem.

In response, Poincaré laid out for the philosophers his judgment of what we knew about the starting points of this most fundamental of sciences, drawing from the full range of his work on the foundations of geometry, geodesy, physics, and philosophy. In his words: 1. There is no absolute space, and we only conceive of relative motion; and yet in most cases mechanical facts are enunciated as if there is an absolute space to which they can be referred. 2. There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, but we have not even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places. I have explained this in an article entitled “Mesure du Temps.” 4. Finally, is not Euclidean geometry in itself only a kind of convention of language?

it is not by chance, it is because [Lorentz’s theory] revealed to us relations unknown until then between facts that apparently were strangers one to the other, and that these relations are real; and that they would be so even if electrons didn’t exist. It is that sort of truth that one can hope to find in a theory, and these truths will survive beyond the theory.

physics to the philosophy or “applying” abstract notions from mathematics or philosophy to physics. Instead, Poincaré was working out a new concept of time, showing how it fit into the rules of three different games: geodesy, philosophy, and physics. Just because the statement of synchronization and simultaneity functioned within all three of Poincaré’s worlds, it took on a singular importance. All through Poincaré’s work lay a Third Republic progressivism, a sense that all aspects of the world could be improved through an engaged reason, a rational, machinic modernism.

In September 1904, just a few weeks later, the International Congress of Arts and Science gathered at St. Louis, Missouri, for an international exposition to celebrate progress. Delivered in the midst of a World’s Fair built to model the world (here Paris, there London, Turin, New York), Poincaré’s speech on the future of physics appropriately aimed to encapsulate the whole field and to identify its weak points.

“The frames are not broken, because they are elastic; but they have been enlarged; our fathers, who established them, have not worked in vain; and we recognize in the science of today the general traits of the sketch that they traced.”75 For Poincaré, physics in 1904 nonetheless stood at the threshold of a new phase in its epochal history. Radium, “that great revolutionary,” had destabilized accepted truths of physics, precipitating crisis. Every principle of nineteenth century physics tottered.

JUNE OF 1905, the contrast between Einstein and Poincaré could not have been greater. Poincaré was an Academician in Paris, fifty-one years old and at the height of his powers. He had been a professor at France’s most illustrious institutions, run interministerial commissions, and published a shelf of books—volumes on celestial mechanics, electricity and magnetism, wireless telegraphy, and thermodynamics. With over 200 technical articles to his name, he had altered whole fields of science. His best-selling volume of philosophical essays had brought his abstract reflections on the meaning of science to a huge audience, including Einstein. Einstein, at twenty-six, was by contrast an unknown patent officer, living in a walk-up flat in a modest section of Bern.

Often this is due to his rather singular passion for hardboiled detective novels and films. He is an impressionable fellow and he likes to act out what he has seen or read, or perhaps he feels compelled to, driven by some inner need to create a persona for himself, otherwise lacking.

Though Einstein never subscribed entirely to what he considered Mach’s overemphasis on the sensory, Einstein did pull from Mach’s writings a critical club to be wielded against idle metaphysical chatter such as the notions of “absolute time” and “absolute space.”34 In Einstein’s favorite work of Mach’s (The Science of Mechanics, 1883) he would have found a polemic against Newton’s absolute time and space that began by citing the master: “Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and by its own nature, flows uniformly on, without regard to anything external. . . . Relative, apparent, and common time is some sensible and external measure of absolute time.” Such thoughts disclosed, according to Mach, not the Newton of hard-boiled facts, but the Newton of medieval philosophy. For Mach, time was not something primitive against which phenomena were measured. Quite the opposite: time itself derived from the motion of things—the earth as it spins, the pendulum as it swings.

While it would be a mistake to assume that the finer details of any single philosopher’s thought leapt whole into Einstein’s work, there is no doubt at all that he emerged from these early Bern years with a powerful sense of the distinction between that which was accessible to our experience and that which was, so to speak, inaccessibly hidden behind the curtain of the perceptible.

Einstein’s goal was altogether different: time would not begin with dynamics. In mid-1905, he advanced a new account of time and space that would start the physics of moving bodies with simple physical principles the way thermodynamics began with the conservation of energy and a forbidden decrease of entropy.

Einstein did not conjure these various flows of simultaneity out of nothing; he snapped a junction into the circuit enabling the currents to cross. Simultaneity had long been in play at many different scales, but Einstein showed how the same flashed signal of simultaneity illuminated all of them, from the microphysical across regional trains and telegraphs to overarching philosophical claims about time and the Universe.

There was, in Einstein’s infinite, imagined clock machine, no national or regional Primäre Normaluhr, no horloge-mère, no master clock. His was a coordinated system of infinite spatiotemporal extent, and its infinity was without center—no Schlesischer Bahnhof linked upward through the Berlin Observatory to the heavens and down along the rails to the edges of empire. By infinitely extending a time unity that had originally been conceived according to the imperatives of German national unity, Einstein had both completed and subverted the project.

Clearly there is no single, unchanged meaning of simultaneity from the early 1890s through 1905. Local time (Ortszeit) began in a geographical sense, became Lorentz’s fictionally offset local time, turned into Poincaré’s light-signal observable offset local time, shifted to Poincaré’s offset and dilated “apparent” time, only to take a new form in Einstein’s relativistic time.

From the time of the American Civil War forward, telegraphic longitude became the modern method for determining simultaneity for longitude. Pushed by the Coast Survey, Europeans rapidly took up the American method, deploying it over land and under sea. By 1899, under Poincaré’s presidency, the Bureau of Longitude had become a global node for sending, receiving, processing, and defining simultaneity.

Reading back from Einstein it is all too easy to cast Poincaré as a reactionary, striving toward (but failing to reach) Einstein’s theory of relativity. Such a retrospective view would bury Poincaré’s reworking of the physics of space and time into a “new mechanics.” It would be as if Picasso were to be jettisoned as antimodern because he was not modern in the sense of Pollock, or to do the same to Proust because his was not the modernism of late Joyce. Reading forward to both Poincaré and Einstein, we can see each breaking with the past in different ways.

In the end, however, the opalescent history of time coordination is falsely presented by reducing it to biography. Cropping the picture to portrait size renders invisible the vast, disputed, standardized conventions of measurable time and space that coursed through Europe and the United States.

After the fighting had ended, Favarger, that avatar of Swiss chronometric unity whom we met earlier, published his 550-page third edition of his technical treatise on electrical timekeeping, framing its detailed electromechanical content, once again, in broadly cultural terms. The Great War, he argued, had contributed powerful technological developments, but it had also destroyed a great part of the human wealth that sustained peace had created.

The Great War, he argued, had contributed powerful technological developments, but it had also destroyed a great part of the human wealth that sustained peace had created. What remained was by contrast “a heap of ruins, miseries and suffering.”23 Humanity needed work to overcome this disaster, and work invariably involved time.

Over the last thirty years it has become a commonplace to pit bottom-up against top-down explanations. Neither will do in accounting for time.

Wir liefen einen Hafen an, der Plymouth heißt, und ich sah es endlich. Dieses England. Ich sah saftiges Grün und weiche Hügel in der Ferne. Und die Passagiere, vor allem jene unter ihnen, die lange in Hitze oder Wüste gedient hatten, sie hatten glasige Blicke. Ich bin mir sicher, keiner riß die Augen so weit auf wie ich. Ich konnte nicht glauben, wie schön dieses Land war, das sie England nennen. Ich wandte mich zu Burton Saheb, und ich weiß noch genau, was ich sagte, Wort für Wort: Was seid ihr Angrezi für Menschen, ein solches Paradies zu verlassen, ohne Zwang und ohne Not, um in ein gottverlassenes Land wie das unsere zu reisen.

this book challenges the idea that scientific and technological developments connected to atomic energy were dictated by the US military.43 But if it is too reductionist to view postwar science and technology as extensions of what Eisenhower termed the “military-industrial complex,” neither does this book defend the unimpeachable autonomy of civilian science and scientists.44 Rather, radioisotopes, as part of a classic “dual-use” technology, exemplify the blurriness of the civilian-military divide.

many of the notable advances enabled by the government's supply of radioisotopes—such as the use of carbon-14 in studying metabolic pathways or the development of teletherapy for cancer using cobalt-60—should not be seen as originating in the atomic age, but as continuing older technologies (p.22) and approaches with new materials and purposes.51 Yet the development of nuclear reactors during the atomic bomb project fundamentally changed the scale of the production and use of radioisotopes—and mass production facilitated their commodification.

Because this is a portion of the body hard to reach with external radiation sources (x-rays), they thought that radiophosphorus might be used to treat blood cell diseases, particularly leukemia. In addition, other features of phosphorus-32 made it an attractive candidate for therapeutic use, namely its brief half-life (14 days), the relatively low penetrating power of its beta rays (2 to (p.35) 4 millimeters of tissue), and the fact that its reaction product, sulfur, was neither radioactive nor toxic.

The three of them were photographed together by Manhattan Project intelligence agents.171This incident occurred after the Rad Lab was mobilized for the war, and unbeknownst to Kamen, the Army's G-2 security agents had developed an elaborate file on him, tracking his associations with leftist musicians and others.

The first edition has also been reproduced in the twentieth century as an exact photo-facsimile, the most well known being edited and introduced by the biologist Ernst Mayr and published by Harvard University Press in 1959. All quotes in the present volume, unless otherwise indicated, are taken from this facsimile. The second edition was produced very soon after the first, on 7 January 1860. Darwin managed to make a few significant corrections. Three thousand copies were printed, making this the largest edition issued in Darwin’s lifetime. Six editions were published by the time of his death in 1882, each one with corrections and alterations. The third edition (1861) is interesting because Darwin added a short ‘Historical Sketch’ in which he described other evolutionary theories. In the fifth edition (1869) he first used the expression ‘survival of the fittest’. The sixth edition, issued in 1872, is usually regarded as the last that Darwin corrected. He intended it to be a popular edition. It was printed in smaller type and cost much less. It was extensively revised and included a whole new chapter in which he answered criticisms. Most modern copies of the Origin of Species are based on this edition.

Yet the impact of evolutionary ideas has waxed and waned since Darwin’s death, paradoxically sometimes at the same time. At the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth, for example, when the evolutionary imperatives of competition and progress were expressed in the social sphere through imperial expansion, free enterprise and eugenic doctrines, and the words ‘survival of the fittest’ were on every lip, many biologists felt that the scientific side of Darwinism was utterly incompatible with early genetics.

Paradoxically again, in the 1930s and 1940s, just when a number of avant-garde biologists hoped to produce a new ‘evolutionary synthesis’, there was strong support for rival systems based on environmentalist ideas of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

Such views naturally generate intense debate. Criticisms are raised against sociobiology and the tendency to reduce everything down to the action of ‘selfish’ genes. Philosophers suggest that selection theory is an invalid form of knowledge, not capable of demonstrable proof. Ordinary people look at the rampant commercial competition and exploitative economic policies around them and wonder whether altruism was ever a basic human trait, whilst modern creationists vigorously challenge the arguments used to support evolution and demand equal time on the school curriculum

Darwin’s father, sisters and cousins all supported the anti-slavery movements of the early nineteenth century – as did he. And the Beagle was travelling the world just when these mass philanthropic movements reached their pinnacle in Britain with the Emancipation Act of 1832.

Gradualism in geology implied gradualism in biology – if the rocks slowly transform in a seamless web of change, then so could animals and plants.

In order to demonstrate that he did not believe in evolutionary matters, he provided a long and aggressive attack on Lamarck.

The success of white Europeans in conquering and settling in Tasmania, for example, seemed to ‘make natural’ the who- lescale extermination of Tasmanian aboriginals. Conquest was deemed a necessary part of progress. A fairly typical view was expressed by Karl Pearson (1857–1936), the committed Darwinian biologist and London statistician. No one should regret, he said in 1900, that ‘a capable and stalwart race of white men should replace a dark-skinned tribe which can neither utilize its land for the full benefit of mankind, nor contribute its quota to the common stock of human knowledge’.

La conception d’apres laquclle un 6tre differencie, complique, evolue, pent avoir perdu des fonctions biochimiques — le pou­ voir de realiser la synthese de tel compose, la possibilite d’attaquer tel autre — ne devrait gSner en rien ceux qui attachent une importance et une signification particulieres a la superiorite intellectuelle de I’espece huniaine. Mais a I’orgueil de cette supe­ riorite, d’ailleurs incontestee, s’est ajoute bien souvent chez cer­ tains representants de I’espece le sentiment solidement enracine d’une pr6cellence s’etendant a tous les domaines, sentiment qui emerge du subconscient lorsque celle-ci est mise en cause

His Monist League promoted German supremacy in the decade before the First World War and indirectly contributed to the rise of fascism afterwards. Embedded in these biologized aspects of society and visions of national ascendancy, Germany’s rulers reached furthest of all with their eugenic law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Progeny (1933). Some 300,000 people were sterilized under this edict until 1939

He investigated natural populations in the 1930s and proposed that similarly small groups in the wild must be subject to what he called ‘genetic drift’.

thinkers of the twentieth century, Mayr was perhaps unique in his grasp of both practical detail and philosophical vision. Like Darwin, he concluded that a new species might develop if a variant group of organisms was geographically isolated in some way from its parent population. Dobzhansky added to Mayr’s proposals by suggesting that there were probably other isolating mechanisms as well, such as behavioural characteristics or different breeding times, all of which would prevent two or more populations from merging. At the same time, G. G. Simpson reinterpreted the fossil record, smoothing out its stops and starts to accommodate the idea of continuous variation.

Then Stebbins showed how a plant’s occasional doubling and trebling of the chromosomes could explain the sudden origin of dramatically different species in the plant world.

Julian Huxley brought them all together in a popular book published in 1942 called Evolution: The Modern Synthesis.

The moth itself could hardly have seemed a better demonstration organism. In nature it exists in two forms, one a speckled black and white, the other a black mutation, called melanic. On ordinary oak trees, the first form is almost invisible. This advantage is reversed in polluted industrial areas where the black form is better

Kettlewell released quantities of both sorts of moth in two wooded sites, one near Manchester, where the trees were blackened by soot, the other in clean countryside in Dorset. He demonstrated that birds ate the most visible form, thereby operating a Darwinian selective pressure that allowed one kind of moth to survive and increase in number at the expense of the other. It categorically showed that selection could alter the frequency of particular genes (in this case the melanic gene) in a population.

We adore eating veal, lamb, beef, antelope, pheasant, or grouse, but we don’t throw away their “leftovers.” We dress in leather and adorn ourselves with feathers. Like the Chinese, we devour duck without wasting a bit; we eat the whole pig, from head to tail; but we get under these animals’ skins as well, in their plumage or in their hide. Men in clothing live within the animals they devoured. And the same thing for plants.

We eat rice, wheat, apples, the divine eggplant, the tender dandelion; but we also weave silk, linen, cotton; we live within the flora as much as we live within the fauna. We are parasites; thus we clothe ourselves.

What travels along the path might be money, gold, or commodities, or even food—in short, material goods. You don’t need much experience to know that goods do not always arrive so easily at their destination. There are always intercepters who work very hard to divert what is carried along these paths.

"Just curious. I've been reading about it—that you guys made uranium and vanadium at the mill." "It's used to harden steel." "Back during the war," Woody says, "they used it to harden weapons." "That's right," Ryland says. "So why did they continue to make it after the war?" "We just processed the stuff. We didn't market it," Ryland says. Sam watches him push the tube into his nose again and again. Ry's nails are yellow and buckled. They look brittle, ragged. Woody's wheezing is getting louder. "They used it for making cooking pots, anything that needed hard steel," Sam says. "Yeah, but I read where the Atomic Energy Commission was your biggest customer. They weren't making pots."

He moved to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Chemistry in Washington, D.C. , and for two more years was able to use part of his time for his old interest. He continued to explore the biological activity of pyridine compounds related to nicotinic acid in curative tests with pigeons. He concluded that alpha-hydroxypyridine in 5-mg doses did have some curative effect in a number of tests and suggested that the variability of response could be the result of the molecule being unstable and changing from one form to another. 22

In diseases such as rickets, and particularly in scurvy, we have had for long years knowledge of a dietetic factor; but though we know how to beneﬁt these conditions empirically, the real errors in the diet are to this day quite obscure.

Elvehjem (1901–1962) was a researcher at the University of Wisconsin with impeccable credentials for work with vitamins. As a youngster growing up in Wisconsin, he learned about Babcock’s early experiments while still in grade school. He wrote his senior thesis with Steenbock, the discoverer of Vitamin D. He had also studied at Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Elvehjem induced black tongue in dogs by feeding them the Goldberger diet. He then cured this illness by supplementing their diet with a substance derived from a liver extract, originally known as vitamin G (G for Goldberger). This substance turned out to be nicotinic acid.

Mais dès ses recherches, Pettit avait constaté premières que son duplex liquefaciens, morphologiquement identique au lacunatus, se multipliait en eau peptonée seule. Il existe, donc, dans le genre Moraxella, deux types différents : l'un se multipliant uniquement en présence de sérum, l'autre pouvant s'en passer. Nous proposons de conserver le nom de Moraxella lacunata aux bactéries du premier type et de réserver le nom de Moraxella duplex pour les bactéries du second type.

Ces expériences montrent que la forme S + possède une certaine stabilité. Nous ne voudrions pas cependant conclure que la transformation S—>-S+ soit irréversible, en d'autres termes, que la transformation S + > S ne puisse avoir lieu. — Le changement S-;>-S+ est, nous l'avons vu, excessivement rare et l'on ne peut conclure d'expériences négatives, en nombre restreint, conduites pendant une durée forcément limitée, à l'impossibilité d'un phénomène dont l'existence n'a pas été constatée.

Simon and Silverman (1983) have presented a partial list of bacterial characters where rapid genetic change has been reported. This list includes most of the characters that bacteriologists interested in variability studied in the first three decades of the twentieth century: surface antigens, flagellar phase variation, colony morphology, pigment variation, bioluminescence, phage sensitivity

The fact that variation to specific carbon com­ pounds occurs in mutabile strains independently of the compound has not been generally recognized.Burri's... conclusions have been frequently quoted but seem to be mainly erroneous... We are obliged to conclude, therefore, that sugars or alcohols act as specific selective agents rather than as stimulators of variation... an organism which has no capacity for spontaneous variation to a carbon compound is not caused to vary to it by cultivation in contact with the compound no matter how long the contact may be prolonged...Variation, when beneficial, may be preserved by selective action of the medium. Nonbeneficial variation, such as poor adaptation to nutrients, would be elimi­ nated by overgrowth of the more vigorous original cells" (Lewis, 1934

Although it is clear now that the S/R conversion was generally a mutation­ al event, many bacteriologists viewed the change in a much more confused way. The most outspoken proponent of a nongenetic explanation of bacterial dissociation was Philip Hadley, who believed that this phenomenon was a central aspect of the life cycle of the organism (Hadley, 1928). According to Hadley, each bacterial species possesses not one "normal" colony form, but a variety, each of which has to be recognized if one is to define the species. Each of these colony forms was related to a stage in the life cycle of individual cells that comprised the colony structure. Hadley argued vigorously against the so-called "monomorphism" school of Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch (see Chapter 3), which insisted on the constancy of bacterial form, "...monomorphism...stiIl clings like a barnacle to modern bacteriology. According to its dictates, whatever departs from the 'normal' must be regarded as an 'involution form,' a degeneration form, a mutant, or a contamination...Are we, then, forced to the conclusion that cultures of the S and R forms are not normal cultures?" (Hadley, 1928). Arkwright, who had coined the terms smooth and rough, supported this interpretation. He stated that the observed bacterial variations should not be called mutation because "the term mutant...has been given a special meaning by botanists and applied to cases of alleged changes in the germ plasm or chromosomes. As bacteria are not known to possess any mechanism resem­ bling chromosomes the term is now generally considered inappropriate" (Arkwright, 1930). 4.6 TRAINING A bacteriological concept related to dissociation was training. The difference between dissociation and training was that dissociation seemed to occur without any obvious external influence, whereas training involved a specific environmental component. In addition, training differed from adaptation in that the latter was a sudden or discontinuous phenomenon, whereas training

resistance. The ramifications of this simple experiment throughout bacterial genetics were numerous. Soon the replica-plating procedure had become a routine method in genetics laboratories and had found its way into most textbooks of either microbiology or genetics. 4.11 RADIATION AND OTHER MUTAGENS Ever since Muller's classic work on the induction of mutations in Drosophila by X-rays (Carlson, 1981), radiation had been used as a tool for probing the nature of the gene. Although most work had been done with X-rays, Demerec (1946) had shown that ultraviolet radiation was also mutagenic in bacteria, greatly increasing the rate of mutation to phage T1 resistance. Alexander Hollaender, at that time at the National Institutes of Health,^ had shown that the most mutagenic wavelengths of ultraviolet were those at 260 nm, the maximum absorption of nucleic acids (Hollaender and Emmons, 1941; Hollaender, 1945). Kinetics of radiation-induced mutation had been used to conclude that a single "hit" was sufficient for the production of a mutation. Since enzyme molecules were scattered throughout the cell, it seemed unlikely that radiation was acting on them. Rather, it was visualized that a specialized center within the cell must be inactivated by radiation; the most likely such center would be the gene. This evidence was used to support the idea that bacteria had genes, but it would not be until the procedures for crossing bacteria were developed that direct evidence for genes in bacteria could be obtained. Phenotypic Lag Demerec and Latarjet (1946) studied the induced mutation process quantita­ tively and showed that some mutations were only expressed after a lag of one ‘Hollaender was later to be the head of the Biology Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He played an important role in promoting the development of bacterial genetics through sponsorship of research and symposia

Il n'est pas certain que le terme de « mutation » utilisé en bactériologie représente un phénomène correspondant à celui qu'on étudie en génétique animale et végétale. Les travaux cytologiques, ceux de Lindegren en particulier, n'ont pu encore prouver l'existence de chromosomes- chez les bactéries. Mais l'existence d'organites homologues aux gènes semble cependant théoriquement probable.

des Bacteries acquierent parfois brusquement des propriet6s, en apparence absentes, par un processus dont les caracteres se rapprochent de ceux des mutations. L’apparition de ces mutations, notons-le, cst independante de la presence du substrat correspondant, et r6tude d’unc souche supposce normale montre qu’il existe parmi les Bacteries en cause un pourcentage tres reduit de mutants

Le mutant, en vertu du jeu de la selection naturelle, remplacera la forme normale primitive ; il sera alors consider6 comnie I’espece normale.Si, par hasard, la forme normale primitive a persiste, elle sera consid6ree comme resultant d’une mutation regressive. S’il existe une evolution physioiogique progressive, il sera done tres difficile de demontrer son existence sauf, si Ton a affaire a dcs organismes chez lesquels la morphologic peut servir de guide pour distinguer ce qui est primitif de ce qui est 6volue, ce qui n’est pas le cas des Bact^ries

status, and so on.Inevitably, these will vary with time and place. It was not uncommon for people to experiment with different kinds of identity, sometimes through anonymous writing and sometimes in a nearly playful mode. 8 Perhaps another way to say this would be that the search for an integrated self was, at least until the end of the eighteenth century, a thing of the future. The notion of self-fashioning is by now something of a cliche´, but if it is treated as historically contingent it can still be a helpful tool for integrating individual lives and cultural contexts. The term was coined by the literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt in his work on Renaissance England; it was adapted by Mario Biagioli for princely court culture in Italy at the time of Galileo. 9 By the eighteenth century, the strategies and contexts for scientiﬁc self-fashioning, or self-presentation, had changed considerably, with the shifting fortunes of rapidly multiplying kinds of science and expanding audiences for science. Recent biographical studies in eighteenth-century science and medicine illustrate these shifts in the meaning of self-fashioning, even when they are not couched in precisely these terms. In his ﬁne biography of Alessandro Volta, Giuliano Pancaldi frames his narrative as “the making of a natural philosopher: from amateur, to expert, to public servant. ” 10 Exploring in detail the cultural and practical ramiﬁcations of Volta’s various discoveries, Pancaldi deconstructs the story of the heroic inventor of the electric battery, an iconic scientiﬁc instrument, and reconﬁgures the tale as the struggle of an ambitious outsider to gain recognition from scientiﬁc and political authorities. The trajectory of Volta’s career leads his biographer to the dynamics of discovery and promulgation of science in a time when the status and aims of physicists and natural philosophers, not to mention electrical showmen, were evolving rapidly. Pancaldi asks what kind of natural philosopher Volta was; to answer the question he looks at the networks of specialists, patrons, and readers for whom Volta honed his scientiﬁc persona. Volta was not a scientiﬁc insider. Hailing from the Lombard region of Italy, he was largely self-taught in experimental physics, and he aspired to use his inventions and novel apparatus and electrical phenomena to make his way into the company of mainstream natural philosophers in London and Paris. Volta proved adept at playing a variety of roles—and at abandoning roles that did not work for him. Pancaldi analyzes his subject’s maneuvering for the support and patronage of various individuals and institutions to develop a full and nuanced history not only of the development of the battery but of the socially and geographically located nature of scientiﬁc investigation. In a slightly different vein, Anita Guerrini’s biography of the fashionable physician George Cheyne explores his efforts to ﬁnd a niche in the Newtonian environment of English medical practice. 11 A Scottish physician who spent much of his career in England, 8 Wahrman has argued this way for eighteenth-century England, where masquerade was a ubiquitous cultural theme and different identities could be put on and taken off quite easily. Anonymity could enable a similar ﬂuidity of identity. See Dror Wahrman, The Making of the Modern Self: Identity and Culture in EighteenthCentury England (New Haven, Conn. : Yale Univ.Press, 2004). On anonymous publication of scientiﬁc texts see Mary Terrall, “Anonymity in the Age of Reason,” in Scientiﬁc Authorship: Credit and Intellectual Property in Science, ed. Mario Biagioli and Peter Galison (New York: Routledge, 2002), pp.91–112. 9 Stephen Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1980); and Mario Biagioli, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism (Chicago: Univ.

Practitioners and would-be practitioners of science self-consciously addressed what they called “the public” and in doing so offered up themselves as well as their work. The public, in this broad sense, was made up of different constituencies with varying interests and motivations, and these constituencies, some more specialized than others, helped to deﬁne the place of science in Enlightenment culture.

Today it is clear to me that at that time I assessed many facts entirely falsely, even especially important facts. Truly captured in error, I nourished illusions which later deceived me; then however I fought, sacriﬁcing everything, for their actualization. I ask myself whether I now can give any guarantee that my judgments of today are correct. Naturally I cannot.—Arnosˇt Kolman 1 Philosophy

Ernst Mach, godfather of the movement, taught at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague from 1867 to 1895, developing his acoustic work, writing some of his important works on empiricism, and (as rector) trying to stave off the eventual bifurcation of the university into a Czech University and a German University in 1882. 6 Even more centrally, Philipp Frank (1884–1966), one of the original participants in the Vienna Circle, assumed the post of professor of theoretical physics at the German University in 1912, and used that position to continue his inquiries into epistemology

In January 1881, the aspiring social theorist Ferdinand Tönnies was holed up in the town of Husum, on the North Sea coast of SchleswigHolstein, agonizing over how to frame a new scholarly project. To a close friend, he wrote that he was thinking of calling it Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, to denote two fundamentally different kinds of society. Their differences were characterized, he wrote, by the contrast between “order and freedom” or between “relations based on obligation,” on one side (Gemeinschaft, or community), and those based on “exchange,” on the other (Gesellschaft, or society

Möbius’s community concept was a central element of a more broadly held approach to nature, which viewed the organism as a living being embedded in nature, whose survival depended on its ability to interact successfully with both its physical environment and the other organisms around it. Commentators in the early twentieth century called this view the “biological perspective

These reasons for historiographical neglect are not intellectually grounded. In terms of scale and inﬂuence, this was one of the twentieth century’s most vigorous philosophies of science, and its history ought to be incorporated into the narratives of the history of philosophy of science we now have.

Even the most uncharitable interpretation of these statements, however, cannot simply dismiss Kolman from our histories of twentieth-century philosophy of science. No less than Prague—an often-overlooked locale that saw the birth or adolescence of many of the logical empiricist doctrines that animated Western philosophy—the story of Czechs and others who went East and signed up for a different philosophy of science (and a different political ideology) must be integrated if we are going to produce an accurate account of the development of the discipline

study of the complex relationships among an organism’s form, its ways of carrying out the functions that allowed it to live, and its environment. This functionalist approach to biology, which goes back to Aristotle, gained considerable momentum in the early nineteenth century, both in the program of the leading French zoologist Georges Cuvier and in the natural theological approach in Britain exemplii ed by William Paley’s natural theology and the Bridgewater Treatises. Interest in these relations intensii ed further in the wake of Darwin’s theory, which rendered the dynamics of the functional relations surrounding adaptation essential to understanding evolution. 33 Functional morphology of this kind was not the only claimant to the mantle of “biology,” but in late nineteenth-century Germany, it was— briel y—the most successful one. Germans sometimes called this “biology in the narrower sense,” to distinguish it from “biology in the general sense,” the science of life. By the 1880s, teachers were using the term as a matter of course, though still dei ning it. Their uses rel ect both its plasticity and its basic elements. Thus, a review in the 1886 opening issue of the Annual Report of the Higher School System , a pedagogical literature review journal, discussed an article that argued that “the consideration of the connection between structure and function of the organs—in short, biology—must be the main element of thought” in natural history teaching, and the reviewer himself argued that the main thing that should be emphasized in natural history instruction was “the relationship between the form of an organ and its biological activity or between where an animal lives and its mode of nutrition.” The same reviewer referred to the curriculum of the reformer Friedrich Junge as starting out from “a group of animals that stand in biological connection to one another”— that is, organisms of different species that interacted, as, for example, food sources or symbionts. In the usage of this single reviewer, then, “biology” referred to relations between structure and function within the animal body, relations between an organism’s anatomical structure and its environment, and ecological relations among animals. The emphasis on ecological interactions was especially prominent among a small but 33. Russell, Form and Function (1982); Bowler, Evolution (2003)

the present story serves as a corrective to a picture of late nineteenth-century German biology (or more properly, zoology) dominated by the rise of university-based, laboratory-oriented professors and their students. By temporarily displacing this undeniably important community and its values from the center of our picture, and focusing instead on a vision of biology that l ourished outside the universities, especially in public museums and schools, we gain a broader picture of the dynamics of the development of biological knowledge. In these civic settings, the axis of tension lay not between morphology and physiology, between historical and mechanical causation, or between natural history and experiment, but between “biology” and systematics

Krogh recollected that when Bohr was interested in the respiratory mechanism of the lung and in the gas exchange through each lung separately, he found a certain kind of tortoise especially suited for such experiments because it possessed a trachea dividing into the main bronchi high up in the neck. They used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purpose of respiration studies. Krogh (1929) had “no doubt there is quite a number of animals which are similarly ‘created’ for special physiological purposes... unknown to the men for whom they were ‘created.’” In his own lecture, Krebs (1975) provided a number of examples to illustrate the August Krogh principle. A fourth theme in Krogh’s thoughts on physiology was the place of facts and their relations to ideas, a subject that has been a central theme in the theories of scientific methods from Aristotle to present (Laudan 1968, Harré 1972, Gjertsen 1989). Krogh said: “When I attempt to pass in review the physiological literature of today I notice certain defects which are too common and which could no doubt be remedied to a certain extent. In a recent small book of instructions for medical writers I find the statement that what is needed in scientific papers is facts and again facts and still more facts. I venture to disagree emphatically with this statement. Facts are necessary, of course, but unless fertilized by ideas, correlated with other facts, illuminated by thought, I consider them as material only for science. I am prepared to submit the thesis, revolting as it may seem, that too many experiments and observations are being made and published and too little thought is bestowed upon them” (Krogh 1929). Claude Bernard Claude Bernard, the founder of modern experimental physiology, is one of the very few biologists who was also a philosopher of his science, according to Gjertsen (1989) perhaps the first since Aristotle. Bernard’s philosophy of physiology is contained in his book, Introduction a l’étude de la Médecine Expérimentale (1865). The book has become a classic, but it seems uncertain how much it has been read, let alone used, by practicing physiologists. It was not translated into English until 1927. Bernard seems to have been the first to discuss the proper use of animals in experiments, pointing out the importance of choosing the right animal for the solution of certain physiological problems. He returned to the question of the choice of animals several times in the book, and a whole section deals with the subject. He wrote: Among the objections that physicians have offered to experimentation is one which must be seriously considered because it throws doubt on the usefulness of animal experiments to human physiology and medicine. It has been said, indeed, that experiments performed on a dog or a frog may be conclusive in their application to dogs and frogs, but never to man, because man has a physiological and pathological nature proper to himself and different from all other animals. It has been further stated that to be really conclusive for man, experiments would have to be made on man or animals as near to him as possible. It was surely with this idea that Galen chose a monkey for his experiments, and Vesalius a pig, as subjects more closely resembling man in his omnivorous capacity. Even today, many people choose dogs for experiments, not only because it is easier to procure this animal, but also because they think that experiments performed on dogs can more properly be applied to man than those performed on frogs. How well founded are these opinions? How much importance should we ascribe to the choice of animals in relation to the usefulness of the experiment to physicians? (Bernard 1927, pp.122–123) In answering these questions, Bernard points out the indispensability of all sorts of animals in experimentation. But among all animals on which physiologists may experiment, some are better suited than others, depending on the problems to be studied, and the solution of a physiological problem often depended on “the happy choice of an animal” for experiment. One of the examples of animals that offered a favorable anatomical arrangement was the cervical sympathetic nerve in rabbits, which allowed Bernard to sever only the vascular nerves and to spare the others, experiments that led to the discovery of the vasomotor control mechanism (Bernard 1927). The relationship between ideas, experimental facts, and thinking is the central theme in Bernard’s philosophy of scientific physiology. His in-depth analysis of experimental physiology opened with some general reflections on the nature of observation and of experiment: 60 BioScience • January 2001 / Vol. 51 No. 1 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/51/1/59/251874 by guest on 30 August 2018

Nobel prizes to "losers " in in biological of why some is not for political, and Implications, Go from Here Has our scholarship about model organisms in the history of 20th century genetics and genomics led to a sort of "canalization" within the field? As has been argued in this essay, our existing accounts of model organisms examine a fairly narrow "band" of the research programs that exist even within genomics and genetics, let alone recent biology. The danger here is that parallel to the canalization of the organisms being explored in these accounts, we have unduly caused our view of contemporary genetics and genomics to be canalized by our focus on this select and rather distinct set of organisms which have very unique histories. So what future directions might our research take in order to counter this trend which may underlie our existing scholarship in order to complement it and round out our narratives? First, it is essential to develop more comparative accounts of various model organisms including more attention to non-genetic model organisms. For example, model organisms might be viewed as

But Little’s dissertation can also be read as an attempt to assert the scientiﬁc power of his more rationalized approach to inbred mice as genetic organisms

The crucial role of variation in the historical development of biology can only be established through a comparative perspective. For the most part such a perspective has been absent from the recent historiography of biology, where the emphasis has been more on the detailed analysis of speciﬁc experimental situations, rather than on a comparison between them

Forced by an increasingly productive experimental system and an eager group of young co-workers, Morgan had abandoned these broader issues and changed direction.

After Caspari succeeded in transplanting wild type testicles into mutant moths and vice versa, it became clear that an intermediate substance (or a gene product) was secreted by the wild type testicles and that this substance was able to darken the mutant moth eyes. 56 This intermediate substance was soon associated with ‘hormone action’, then at the center of many studies in physiology

what strange institutional politics had led to the creation, on opposite ends of the same campus, of two departments whose scientific agendas seemed nearly indistinguishable: molecular biology and biochemistry. (I happened to work for the only professor with appointments in both departments, which merged during my years there.) A few years later, having given up laboratory work to pursue the history of biology, I was writing an article on the development of a particular line of research at Berkeley. No one, I realized, had done an institutional study of postwar biology there that I could draw on as background to my story. So I ven­ tured into the archives to try to pull together a bit of institutional history. There I encountered Wendell Stanley, the Nobel Laureate who came to Berkeley in 1948 to recreate biochemistry on campus, and whose inability to manage the biochemists led to the formation of an additional mole­ cular biology department in 1964. Stanley’s style of leadership, I found, derived not from a brilliant scientific vision nor from political savvy, but from his promotion of a particular object of research, the virus. His single- minded advocacy of virus research helped him acquire a small research empire in Berkeley and a prominent role as a scientific statesman. Tlie more I read of Stanley, the more interested I became in viruses—and in Stanley’s favorite virus, tobacco mosaic virus, or TMV. Given this plant virus’s significance to biology, and to molecular biology in particular, I was surprised that so little had been written on it. I decided to tell the story of TMV, the tobacco pathogen turned laboratory model. In the course of working on this book, I have benefited from the support of many organizations and individuals.

What you also must know is that John is a most powerful witch. In the summer of 2012, just after the thunder of God split Jabberwocky in half, John spent that first summer laboring over 39 giant stones. From sun-up to sun-down, he spent every waking hour tilting the stones, twisting their base, shifting their balance until everything was just right. My cousin Cesar recalled this with a laugh, thinking the old man to be berserk. But there is more powerful magick at work here than what Cesar can recognize. Forgive him for this oversight, as even I am foggy on these sacred rites. Stone magick is tricky, as it involves calibrating the Earth’s ley lines according to pulsating knots in the aether clouds. Much can interfere with getting a clear measurement including rain, light pollution, quantum avalanches, et cetera. John labored over these great stones much like the giants of Hyperborea labored over the rocks at Callanish. Their placement, which many at camp dismissed as aesthetics, in fact manifested a powerful charm at the heart of Jabberwocky. And so one day walking through the rustic wabe

opposition between the holistic view and a more reductionist perspective. One topic that will emerge in the course of this chapter is precisely the historical development of the debates arising from this crucial question. THE STUDY OF PLANT COMMUNITIES Recognition of the interactions between the various organisms inhabiting an area goes back at least as far as the Swedish naturalist Carl Linneaus. More systematic work, however, began in the early nineteenth century. While traveling in “equinoxial America” between 1799 and 1804, the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt (1869–1859) and his French companion, the marine surgeon and botanist Aime Bonpland ( ´ 1773–1858), had attempted to ascend Mount Chimborazo in the Peruvian altiplano. They had observed the parallel strips of vegetation that covered the sides of the mountain up to the limits of perpetual snow. As the vegetation’s physiognomy changed with the altitude, Humboldt and Bonpland were brought to the conclusion that the climatic gradient, dependent on altitude, was the main environmental factor governing the phenomenon. Later, they established a parallel between these observations and the physiognomic changes of vegetation depending on latitude. In both cases, they considered that vegetational landscapes resulted from plant “associations.” Humboldt introduced the phrase “geography of plants” to denote the science that considered the relations between vegetation and climate. From then on, much of the research inspired by the programmatic outlines of Humboldt’s Essai sur la g´eographie des plantes (Essay on the Geography of Plants) was focused on plant and animal communities and not on individuals or Linnaean species. However, the studies of the physical factors of the environment were not neglected; as early as 1820, the Genevan botanist Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle (1778–1841) took into consideration factors such as light, the importance of which had been underestimated. Another landmark in the study of plant communities was the physiognomic conception of the plant formation introduced by the Gottingen ¨ botanist August Heinrich Rudolf Grisebach (1813–1879), who deﬁned the phytogeographical formation as a group of plants possessing a deﬁnite physiognomical characteristic, such as a meadow, a pine forest, or a tundra. 9 9 August Heinrich Rudolf Grisebach, “Uber den Einﬂuss des Climas auf die Begr ¨ anzung der ¨ Naturlichen Floren,” ¨ Linnea, 12 (1838), 160.

the hypothesis that the Archaea were so very diﬀerent from bacteria because the two groups diverged when life was quite new was complicated when genes other than those for rRNA were compared.

Das Buch verankert das 19. Jahrhundert auf wechselnde Weise «in der Geschichte», und es leistet sich bewusst scheinbar anachronistische Rückgriffe weit hinter 1800 oder 1780 zurück oder Vorgriffe bis nahe an die Gegenwart heran. Auf diese Weise soll der Stellenwert des 19. Jahrhunderts in längeren Abläufen gleichsam trianguliert werden. Manchmal ist es uns fern, manchmal sehr nah; oft ist es die Vorgeschichte der Gegenwart, zuweilen versunken wie Atlantis.

The phrase ‘total war’ appears to have been coined by the German aphorist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in or around 1776.49 Now it acquired a grim reality. The new forms taken by both the sea and the air wars pointed to the transformation of the nature of warfare itself. This was a war in which, in the end, access to raw materials and production capacity were the keys to victory. Not only fortresses and cities but virtually the entire civilian populations of countries found themselves, in eVect, under siege

The reputation of the royal family was further damaged by gossip about the evil inXuence exerted by the miracle-working holy man (often inaccurately called a monk) Grigory Rasputin. His assassination in December 1916 by Prince Felix Yusupov and other members of the nobility was a sign that disaVection had penetrated even the ruling class

But in an election to the Bavarian Diet in early January 1919, his USPD won only 2.5 per cent of the vote and he was obliged to step down. On 21 February 1919, on his way to the opening session of the Diet, Eisner was assassinated. The murder radicalized the left-wing Socialists who declared a Bavarian Councils’ Republic (Ra¨terepublik) on 7 April.

One of those three surprises involves an anomalous form of creature, a whole category of life, previously unsuspected and now known as the archaea. (Their name gets uppercased when used as a formal taxonomic category: Archaea.) Another is a mode of hereditary change that was also unsuspected, now called horizontal gene transfer. The third is a revelation, or anyway a strong likelihood, about our own deepest ancestry. We ourselves—we humans—probably come from creatures that, as recently as forty years ago, were unknown to exist.

The recognition of horizontal gene transfer (HGT, in the alphabet soup of the experts) as a widespread phenomenon has overturned the traditional certitude that genes flow only vertically, from parents to offspring, and can’t be traded sideways across species boundaries.

Genes don’t move just vertically. They can also pass laterally across species boundaries, across wider gaps, even between different kingdoms of life, and some have come sideways into our own lineage—the primate lineage—from unsuspected, nonprimate sources.

science itself, however precise and objective, is a human activity. It’s a way of wondering as well as a way of knowing. It’s a process, not a body of facts or laws. Like music, like poetry, like baseball, like grandmaster chess, it’s something gloriously imperfect that people do. The smudgy fingerprints of our humanness are all over it.

That one word, branching, was freighted with interesting implications: of directional growth, of divergence, of an arboreal form.
